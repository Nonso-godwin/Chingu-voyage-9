This is a solo project to prepare me for the task ahead
in the Chingu Voyage 9 cohort.
Though this is the first time, I will be writing major (in my language)
javascript even though it is considered as beginners DOM 
manipulations. I hope to continually build on this effort and I am still
opened to corrections from fellow programmers around the world.

I will now start working on making the page responsive as much as I
can, the goal is to become a better developer with or without
libraries or framework.

Also, I am getting a bit familiar with git gradually.

I had to pull to effect some corrections.

18th May:
I finished the clock display, only to realise it only works fine when the minute counter is greater than 10
It only displays the value with no leading zero.

19th May:
I added the leading zero to the clock's minute.
Added the scroll property to the Javascript list and 
hid the scrollbar using the 
::-webkit-scrollbar css function and it worked absolutely fine.
I hope to see how best I can work on the responsiveness without altering the sequence of my codes.
To a large extent, my git workflow is now getting improved by the day,
and it feels this whole experience of voyage cohort is NOT a waste of time in anyway.

I have learnt that working in a team is the one of the best way to learn.

Thanks Chingu.
I will be tracking my progress though this text document.
