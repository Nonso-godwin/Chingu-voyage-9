This is a solo project to prepare me for the task ahead
in the Chingu Voyage 9 cohort.
Though this is the first time, I will be writing major (in my language)
javascript even though it is considered as beginners DOM 
manipulations. I hope to continually build on this effort and I am still
opened to corrections from fellow programmers around the world.

I will now start working on making the page responsive as much as I
can, the goal is to become a better developer with or without
libraries or framework.

Also, I am getting a bit familiar with git gradually.

I had to pull to effect some corrections.
