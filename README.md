This is a solo project to prepare me for the task ahead
in the Chingu Voyage 9 cohort.
Though this is the first time, I will be writing major (in my language)
javascript even though it is considered as beginners DOM 
manipulations. I hope to continually build on this effort and I am still
opened to corrections from fellow programmers around the world.

I will now start working on making the page responsive as much as I
can, the goal is to become a better developer with or without
libraries or framework.

Also, I am getting a bit familiar with git gradually.

I had to pull to effect some corrections.

18th May:
I finished the clock display, only to realise it only works fine when the minute counter is greater than 10
It only displays the value with no leading zero.

19th May:
I added the leading zero to the clock's minute.
Added the scroll property to the Javascript list and 
hid the scrollbar using the 
::-webkit-scrollbar css function and it worked absolutely fine.
I hope to see how best I can work on the responsiveness without altering the sequence of my codes.
To a large extent, my git workflow is now getting improved by the day,
and it feels this whole experience of voyage cohort is NOT a waste of time in anyway.

I have learnt that working in a team is the one of the best way to learn.

Thanks Chingu.
I will be tracking my progress though this text document.

Realized that there may be need for more contents to be added to the 
mid section of the page and as such, it may overflow to after the section that is 
already assigned to the timer, so I activated the scroll element for it using css overflow property.
Good thing is once ::-webkit-scrollbar {} is declared in your css, it works throughout your the pages linked
with the css file so no need to call it often.
